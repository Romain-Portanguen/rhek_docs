| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | The project is built with React and TypeScript, providing a collection of custom React hooks aimed at extending the capabilities of React applications. It follows a modular architecture promoting code reusability.                      |
| 🔩  | **Code Quality**  | The codebase maintains high quality and adheres to best practices in React and TypeScript development. It includes linting, type checking, and coverage reporting for ensuring code reliability.                                           |
| 📄  | **Documentation** | The project features detailed documentation generated using typedoc, emphasizing public API while excluding private details. This enhances code understanding and facilitates easy integration for developers.                             |
| 🔌  | **Integrations**  | Key external dependencies include Jest, ESLint, Babel, Prettier, and various React-related libraries for testing, linting, and transpilation tasks. These integrations enhance the development workflow and tooling support.               |
| 🧩  | **Modularity**    | The codebase is structured in a modular way, with each custom hook providing specific functionality that can be easily integrated into React components. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.                               |
| 🧪  | **Testing**       | Testing is conducted using Jest and @testing-library/react for comprehensive unit and integration testing. The project includes tests for each custom hook to ensure functionality and reliability.                                        |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | The project focuses on efficiency and performance, as seen in the minify script that optimizes code for production deployment. Custom hooks like use-throttle and use-debounce enhance user interactions and reduce unnecessary rendering. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**      | Security measures include managing dark mode state using localStorage and clipboard actions with proper access control. The use of localStorage for certain hooks ensures data protection and secure interactions.                         |
| 📦  | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include TypeScript, Jest, React, ESLint, Prettier, and other utility libraries for enhancing development processes. These libraries extend the project's capabilities and support various functionalities.                |
